## Supplementary Input files for Scripts

This folder contains the files used by scripts for this project to help specify the sample, lane, scaffolds etc.

The files required for each script should be saved in the directory in which teh script will be run. For most file this will be in the main project folder. See the notes in the relevant scripts to confirm where each should be saved. 

The **HiC_scaffold_1_NARW_samples** is a sample-name-map for genomicsDBimport. A new file needs to be created for each scaffold for each species.
